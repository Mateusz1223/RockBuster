# Compilation and run

Project depends on external 32-bit SFML 2.5.1 library https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ (but probably can be compiled with 64-bit version too).

<br />
When running needs Fonts, Sounds and Textures folders and openal32.dll in execution path (SFML dlls are required when dynamic linked).
