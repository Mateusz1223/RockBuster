# RockBuster

Rock Buster is a space shooter game which I wrote in C++ using SFML library.

# Compilation and run

Project depends on external 32-bit SFML 2.5.1 library https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/.
<br />
<br />
Note that project uses Windows dependent libraries to find Documents folder where it saves game data (StateData.cpp).
<br />
<br />
In order to run properly the executable needs Fonts, Sounds and Textures folders and openal32.dll/openal64.dll in execution path (SFML dlls are required when dynamic linked).
